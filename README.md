My implementation of some common statistics and hypothesis testing utility classes

Including:
* Ordinary Least Square Regression
* Correlation p-value
* Analysis of Variance (K-Sample F-test)
* Student's T-test

Machine learning is very popular these days, but I still find these classical statistic methods useful.  Ranking by p-value or effect sizes can also be an effective feature selection strategy.
